  Ctrl-R Ctrl-P  inserts a register literally, and fixes indent
When selected with shift, T/Tab indents, D/U/Shift-Tab deindents
 ('I' is not used so as not to clash with iW/is/ib/ip/iB text objects)
When selected with shift, Shift-T / Space indent by a single column
 (Shift-D/U/Space deindent).  Bug: Space / Shift-Space do not work.

 (With a rectangular selection, Shift-O goes horizontally).
